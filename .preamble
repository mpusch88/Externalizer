This project aims to create a VST3 plugin using the JUCE framework, replicating Ableton Live's External Audio Effect device. The plugin will enable audio routing to/from external hardware processors in a DAW, provide latency compensation, dry/wet control, and gain staging. Development involves using Projucer, implementing features, designing a UI, and testing across platforms and DAWs.
